## GML-Graph-Framework 
### A WIP library for Creating and Manipulating 2D Graphs.

#### Current Features
1) Create Graphs
2) Add/Remove Nodes and Edges
3) Tag Nodes
4) Circle/Grid Layout
5) Spring Embedded Layout

#### Planned Features
1) Simple Tree Layout
2) Find
3) Replace


### Structure
1) base/base.gml - contains graph and node structs and all the methods for manipulating them
2) creation/creation.gml - contains functions for quickly creating graphs based on given criteria. currently only have creating a new graph of order N.
3) layout/layout.gml - contains layout methods (currently circlular/grid/spring embedded)
4) rewrite/rewrite/gml - contains nothing, this will eventually house find/replace algorithms if they are ever implemented.

All library code is in the /scripts folder. This repository has the whole project that I have been using to test/debug as I go so it has other gamemaker assets that are not relevant.
